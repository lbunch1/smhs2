          Kudos to Terry and Jan Shea for outwitting the freaky Friday deluge. All
          it took was trip to Home Depot for a giant tarp and Terry’s intrepid
          installation on top of his patio structure. The opening party was fun
          and relatively drip-free.

          Clouds parted for the Saturday main event, and the sun made a full
          entrance on Sunday (natch) for those who didn’t want the 50ish to end.
